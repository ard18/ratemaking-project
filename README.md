# (Note: Project is Work in Progress)
The goal of this project is to make a ratemaking/pricing automation model for worker's compensation premiums. Actuarial Ratemaking or Pricing is one of the primary operations of an actuary. This process combines actuarial judgement and statistical techniques to determine the new premiums or rates to cover an insurer’s claims, expenses and other potential liabilities while maintaining profitability. It also ensures fairness and adequacy of coverage to the insured.
The dataset has been taken from Casualty Actuarial Society’s Research Resources, titled - “Loss Reserving Data Pulled from NAIC Schedule P”. The claims data comes from Schedule P – Analysis of Losses and Loss Expenses in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) database. The dataset being used is the Workers’ Compensation dataset. (https://www.casact.org/publications-research/research/research-resources/loss-reserving-data-pulled-naic-schedule-p)
I have chosen the Python 3 language for this project.
